My male cat Lorenzo has picked up a very disturbing habit. He has started doing messed up stuff to my poor innocent teddy bears, but I've seen that kinda thing with my other cats before so I didn't think much of it. But lately he has started to climb on the bed with the doll and do shit to it while looking at me the entire duration of my workout. And what makes me the most uncomfortable is when I move around the room and he continues to follow me with his eyes making direct eye contact at all times. Is this normal? Can male cats be attracted to female humans? Is he a pervert? Or a skin walker? Or just too horny? And how do I fix him?
